# The first version of Brastel Remit web site (2012)

Brastel Remit is an international money transfer service released in March 2012. I did the main web site and the customer web site.

The web site has been totally renewed in July 2O14, using "Responsive Web Design" ideas.
This static web site is a demonstration of the previous layout. 

This web site has been built using docpad, a static web site generator built on top of node.js.
